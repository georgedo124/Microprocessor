# Microprocessor Course 

When I finished this course, I was extremely happy. Two years ago, when I dropped out of my first year of college. I have self-learned to decompile software. I tried to study but couldn't figure out why it was like that. What are the AX, DX registers for?  
I gave up. 

This time, after having little knowledge of computer architecture. I took this course right away. I'm so happy because it made me understand what Assembly language is. 

I'm very grateful to Mr. Nguyen Huy Hoang - lecturer at Hanoi University of Science and Technology for this series of lectures.
